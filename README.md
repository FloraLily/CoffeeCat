# CoffeeCat

A website created as part of the Code First: Girls course in basic website development, A/W 2015. 
CoffeeCat aims to encourage people to vsit independent coffee shops in their local community. We wanted to use geolocation and user-generated reviews to enable individuals to discover local cafes that suit their specific needs (e.g. fast wifi, child-friendly, romantic, organic, affordable).
