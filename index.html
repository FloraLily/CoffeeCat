<h3> About Us </h3>

  <p> With so many coffee shops to choose from how do you find the right one? 

  <br>
  <br>


We decided to create this awesome website because we love independent coffee shops and think they are worth supporting. 

 <br> Durham offers such a diverse range of cafes. Coffee Cat has them all in one place to help you pick the right one for your cafe needs. You want cake; we got cake. You want artisanal coffee; we got some of that too. You need a peaceful place to study; we know where they hide all the plugs and fast Wi-Fi. 

 <br>
 <br> Small wonder cats get the cream.
